I'm currently an undergraduate student at UMass Amherst studying Computer Science and Mathematical Computation. I'm an aspiring Machine Learning Engineer but am also interested in Robotics, Mobile Application Development, and Full Stack Development. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions about my projects or if you just want to chat. You can find more information about me on my LinkedIn and on my personal website.
