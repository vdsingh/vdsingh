### Hi! I'm Vik ðŸ‘‹

Everything I develop is completely viewable to anyone (with the exception of code that I write for other people of course). You have my permission to copy/paste whatever you want for your own purposes! If you use my code, I would appreciate credit, but it is not necessary.

I'm currently an undergraduate student at UMass Amherst studying Computer Science and Computational Mathematics. I'm interested in Mobile Application Development, User Experience, and Artificial Intelligence. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions about my projects or if you just want to chat. You can find more information about me on my LinkedIn and on my personal website.

The pinned projects are the mobile apps I've developed/am developing. 

* If you're curious EvolveAI is my most recent project and most accurately reflects my skills *
